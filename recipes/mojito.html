    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A refreshing summer drink originating from the carribean. This drink is made from rum,
        however, what makes the drink a classic is the refreshing mint and lime addition to the palate.
        Nothing beats a sweet citrus and mint rum cocktail to cool off with on a hot day. Except one with ice...
